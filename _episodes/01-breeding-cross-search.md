## Breeding Crosses Search---Pea Breeding Scenario

Breeding Cross Search is a powerful searching tool that allows you to look up a germplasm and its relevant information for a crossing block.
Let us say there is a *Pisum sativum* germplasm I would like to use again this year, but I cannot recall the name of it. The only thing I can remember now is that it has CDC Centennial as one of its parents, meanwhile, the previous experiment was conducted in 2008.
